Title: This package is used to test whether sequences for dN/dS calculations are in FASTA format, if the sequences are the same size, if there is a suitable amount of gaps, and grabs the splitting locations of strands of a beta barrel for use in calculation.

Description: This package contains 4 functions as well as their unit testing files to test the Title
        is_protein.R -> This function tests the gappiness of the sequences in a multiple sequence alignment. If the gaps are too large then the sequences are not suitable for dN/dS calculation and will fail the test.
        same_size.R -> This function tests if the sequences in the multiple sequence alignment are the same size. This is required to generate a square matrix in order to make dN/dS calculations
        strand_ident.R -> This function will take in a topology file for secondary structure to split up the beta barrel into it's corresponding strands. Since I'm looking at strand selection pressure, this function is critical in seperating out the sequences
          File for testing: query.top (this contains a topology file for a 16 stranded beta barrel)
        test_calc.R -> This function tests whether or not the sequences are in FASTA format. If they are, and you have passed the other tests, then you can proceed with splitting up the strands to feed into calculation
